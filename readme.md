## Map Description: Bird Migration
This project is is a simple interactive web map built with [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) and tells the story of the busiest night of the fall 2025 bird migration across the United States. Between October 8th and October 9th, millions of birds traveled south. This map allows users to see which states had the highest "flyover" rates (counted in birds per square mile). Additionally, the bird icon points depict five migrating songbird species that were seen during the day on either October 8th or 9th by various iNaturalist users.
